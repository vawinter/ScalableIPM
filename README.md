## A Scalable Integrated Population Model for Estimating Abundance for Gamebird Management
# Integrated Population Model (IPM) for Wild Turkey in Pennsylvania

### IPM models

The 'complex' IPM is looking at WMU level harvest rates, survival, abundance, for males and females.

### Demographic Parameters of Interest:
- **Survival**
- **Abundance**
- **Recruitment**

### Estimating by:
- **Season:** Females = November, Males = May
- **WMU:** 3 WMUs
- **Sex:** Male, Female
- **Age Class:** Adult, Juvenile

### Models:

#### Males:
- **Dead Recovery Model:** Estimates harvest and survival rates per Wildlife Management Unit (WMU) or region level.
- **Lincoln-Peterson Estimator:** Determines abundance at four biologically relevant time points throughout the year.

#### Females:
- **Known-Fate Model:** Estimates annual survival from telemetered females.
- **Recruitment Models:**
  - **Hen with Brood (HWB) Model:** Estimates number of hens with poults on September 1.
  - **Poults:Brood (PPB) Model:** Estimates number of poult:brood.
- **Lincoln-Peterson Estimator:** Estimates abundance at four biologically relevant time points throughout the year.
